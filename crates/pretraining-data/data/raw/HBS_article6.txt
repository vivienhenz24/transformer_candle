Research: When Does Scientific Decision-Making Benefit Startups?

Summary.   New research on 261 UK start-ups reveals that adopting a scientific approach to decision-making can have different effects depending on the maturity of the business model. Established ventures that used scientific methods to optimize their existing strategies saw immediate performance gains, whereas early-stage start-ups experienced economic performance declines as they questioned and revised fundamental business assumptions. These findings highlight how the impact of scientific decision-making varies based on a firm’s stage of development, with important implications for founders, investors, and business educators on evaluating start-up performance and supporting entrepreneurial growth. 
Founders know the mantra: make data-driven decisions. In recent years, the scientific approach to nurturing start-ups—developing hypotheses, collecting evidence that either supports or refutes them, and letting the data guide decisions—has been shown to boost ventures’ performance.
But our new research suggests this approach isn’t universally beneficial. In fact, for early-stage startups still figuring out their core business model, the scientific approach might hurt their  economic performance, at least in the short term.
Our finding is based on a field experiment with 261 startups from a range of industries at varying stages of development in the United Kingdom. Our work revealed an interesting dichotomy: Startups with well-defined business models saw immediate gains in performance—measured in terms of revenue—from adopting a scientific approach to decision-making, whereas early-stage ventures experienced performance declines.
The key difference? How evolved their fundamental business model was—and what kind of problems they used the scientific method to help solve.
Who Does the Scientific Method Benefit?
Our study, published in the Strategic Management Journal, used a simple design: We created a business support program that trained all participating entrepreneurs in decision-making frameworks, such as the business model canvas, and skills, including how to conduct A/B testing. In addition to these trainings, half of the participants were also taught and encouraged to use a scientific approach for making decisions. We also asked participants about their firm’s strategic vision and how likely their firm was to make a radical change. This helped us determine how mature a startup’s business model was. Those firms with well-articulated strategies resistant to major changes were considered mature, while those with flexible models were considered early-stage.
Following the trainings, we conducted regular interviews with participants to gauge their use of the scientific method and we collected data on each firms’ revenue for nine months. We found a relationship between firm maturity and the kinds of problems the scientific method was being applied to: Mature startups that adopted scientific decision-making used it to optimize and fine-tune their existing strategies, while less developed startups applied this methodology to help answer more existential questions.
For example, one founder of a mature company that sold memory cards, among other items, explained that they used the scientific approach to refine their theory of what kinds of product descriptions would convert more shoppers into customers. “We started advertising our products as…memory solutions for those specific devices,” the founder told us. “Once we had these different listings… we [found this to be] the best method.”
This focused experimentation led to higher performance—the company increased their profits by 10% after changing their approach to product listings.
In contrast, early-stage founders were more likely to apply scientific methods to problems that forced them to question their fundamental assumptions. “Before coming into the program, we had a very clear vision,” said one participant. “But as we’ve rigorously tested our hypotheses and ideas, we’re less clear on which pain points we’re reducing for users. So that’s the thing we’re [now] trying to ensure.”
This deeper exploration often led to major strategic pivots that stalled growth while founders reassessed their entire business models.
Taking the Long View
A limitation of our study was that it only measured revenue growth for a nine-month window. While we found that early-stage startups saw revenue hits after applying the scientific method to decision-making, the majority of the early-stage founders we spoke with described this period of experimentation positively, noting that they believed the methodology had helped them refine their vision and would drive long-term growth.
As one early-stage founder who took a scientific approach reflected, “We’ve stepped back… it is needed to improve ourselves and then come out better.”
Another said they were  ”looking longer term and thinking how we can actually turn that into a more viable business.”
We hypothesize that the initial phase of uncertainty, while challenging for metrics-focused founders and investors in the short run, may help drive long-term success. By thoroughly examining assumptions before making major strategic commitments, early-stage startups can avoid the kinds of mistakes which may lead to short-term profit growth, but result in unstable long-term models. The scientific method can therefore be an important tool that gives early startups a chance to rigorously test the long-term viability of their business models—even while knowing that it may lead to some temporary performance dips in terms of revenue.
Practical Implications
We recommend that entrepreneurs—and investors—consider startups’ development stage before adopting highly systematic approaches. While we believe the scientific model is beneficial along a startup’s development arc, how that success is evaluated may need to change depending on a firm’s maturity.
Early-stage startup founders
The key is to embrace uncertainty as a natural element of the scientific approach during initial stages. Leaders should anticipate and prepare for potential short-term performance dips while they explore fundamental assumptions. The focus should be on developing a comprehensive “theory of value” before diving into metric optimization. It’s crucial to set appropriate expectations with stakeholders about this exploratory phase, as trying to rush through it may put the business on an avoidable path that ultimately leads to failure.
Established startup founders
Success comes from applying scientific methods to optimize within your established business model. This involves implementing systematic testing across product features, marketing approaches, and customer service initiatives, while carefully tracking and measuring the impact of these incremental improvements.
Investors
It’s essential to adjust performance expectations based on the maturity of a startup’s business model. They should place value on thorough strategic exploration in early stages, even when it temporarily impacts growth metrics. Rather than focusing solely on quick wins, investors should look for signs of thoughtful, systematic learning within the organization.
. . .
The key lesson isn’t that scientific decision-making is good or bad for certain firms—it’s that timing and context matter. Early-stage start-ups need room to explore and question fundamental assumptions, even if that creates temporary uncertainty. More established start-ups can use scientific methods to optimize within their existing frameworks, leading to quick performance gains.
Successful founders must understand this distinction and adapt their decision-making approach accordingly, knowing to step back and reassess fundamentals, and when to apply rigorous testing to optimize what’s working. In the end, scientific decision-making is like any other tool—its effect on performance depends not just on using it, but what you use it for.
